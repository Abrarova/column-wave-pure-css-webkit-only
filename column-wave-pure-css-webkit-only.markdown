Column wave (pure CSS, WebKit-only)
-----------------------------------
[Watch me code this in under 15 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnwIg4iWq1I) (you can also speed it up if you feel I'm typing/ speaking too slow).  WebKit-only. Firefox doesn't support using  `calc()` in place of much else other than length values, so time, angle values or the `%` value inside `hsl()` are a problem ([meta bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1376206)). Edge doesn't support  much of this either (it does support `calc()` in `hsl()` at least). If you like this demo in particular and my work in general and you want me to be able to continue putting stuff out, please consider one of the following:

* showing your appreciation with a donation:

* getting me something from [my Amazon WishList](https://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/2Y3C4722GXH0I/)

* or at least sharing this to show the rest of the world what can be done with CSS on the web these days

Thank you!
